Cheers! I'm a second year PhD student in [http://ilps.science.uva.nl ILPS], [http://http://www.uva.nl/en/home University of Amsterdam, UvA], supervised by [https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/ Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke]. Before joining in ILPS, 
I received my bachelor degree from [http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/ TJU] in 2009. My mentor was [http://www.tjucs.win/faculty/wangxin/index-en.html Dr. Xin Wang]. 
Then I received my master degree from [http://en.ustc.edu.cn/ USTC], supervised by [http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hchen Prof. Dr. Huanhuan Chen] in 2013. 
My research interests are information retrieval, machine learning and bandits. Meanwhile I'm open to new challenges at all time.
